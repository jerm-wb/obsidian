# Standard
- Primary storage used for frequently accessed data
- High throughput, low latency
# Intelligent-Tiering
- Dynamic storage used for data with unpredictable access patterns
- Automatically moves data between two access queues
- Designed for savings in storage cost without performance impact
# Infrequent Access
- Deeper storage used for data that is accessed less frequently but needs to be gotten quickly when needed
- Has a retrieval fee
## One Zone-Infrequent Access
- Infrequent access set up in only one Availability Zone, used for secondary backups or data that is easily reproducable

# Glacier
## Instant Retrieval
- Even deeper storage designed to be used with archival data

- Lower cost
## Deep archive
- Deepest archival service, used for data that is basically never retrieved
