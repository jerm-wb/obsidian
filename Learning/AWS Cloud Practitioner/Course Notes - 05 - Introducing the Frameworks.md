# Well-Architected Framework Overview
## Six Pillars
### Security
- Focuses on protection of data, systems, and any assets used by your workload
- E.g. using CloudTrail to log all actions performed in your account
### Cost Optimization
- Focuses on the ongoing process of maintaining costs in the cloud
- Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering to automatically move data
### Performance Efficiency
- Focuses on the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet requirements
- Use Lambda to run code with zero administration
### Operational Excellence
- Focusing on creating applications that successfully support your workload
- Use CodeCommit for code and template version control
### Reliability
- Focuses on architecting a workload to be consistent and able to recover quickly
- Use Multi-AZ deployments of RDS databases
### Sustainability
- Focuses on environmental impacts like energy efficiency and consumption
- Use EC2 Auto Scaling to ensure maximum utilization
## General Design Principles
- Stop guessing your capacity needs by collecting usage data
- Test systems at production scale
- Consider evolutionary architectures
- Automate with architectural experimentation in mind
- Drive architectures using data by leveraging usage information
- Improve through game-days (drills)
